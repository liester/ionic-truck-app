This application is the mobile web portion of an application built to be used by Perry's Towing (tow truck company).

It integrates with a back end server to allow tow truck drivers to communicate their status back to the dispatcher in a way that does not interrupt the dispatcher's work process.

To start the application locally:
clone repository
cd into parent directory, where the package.json is located
run 'npm start'
